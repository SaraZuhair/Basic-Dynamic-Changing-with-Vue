      <!--there are two ways to set the property of a class there is v-bind class
      and v-bind style, it is more preferred to use v-bind class because you can 
      style that class in whatever way needed but if u use v-bind style
      you will need to style the div using inline styling -->
      <div
        class="demo"
        :class="{active: boxASelected}"
        @click="boxSelected('A')"
      ></div>
        <!--this is another way as we know computed can be used for dynamic changing
        so if the code was complex we can bind a class easily with the computed
        value-->
      <div class="demo"
      :class="boxB"
      @click="boxSelected('B')"></div>

        <!--this is another way which is called inline styling which is
        not preffered alot since you can't set many properties for an
        element-->
      <div class="demo"
      :style="{borderColor: boxCSelected ? 'purple' : '#ccc'}"
      @click="boxSelected('C')"></div>
